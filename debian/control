Description: lightweight C++ template library for linear algebra
 Eigen is a lightweight C++ template library for vector and matrix math, 
 a.k.a. linear algebra.
 .
 Unlike most other linear algebra libraries, Eigen focuses on the simple 
 mathematical needs of applications: games and other OpenGL apps, spreadsheets 
 and other office apps, etc. Eigen is dedicated to providing optimal speed 
 with GCC.
